## Description
Empress Voroti has crowned you Queen but you goddam went and lost your crown didn't you, of course you had plenty of Size-ist magazines, Haters, and Diet Ads to confuddle you into forgetting your fabulous QUEEN STATUS. Empress Voroti is gathering all Queens for a DanceHall and Bashment Rave and no crown, no entry Baby so get to it.


## MVP deliverables
A background canvas with 4 Platforms.
A PLAYER with moving functionality (LEFT, RIGHT, FLY) collecting Confidence elements adding to a "Confidence Score".
Goal is to reach the crown at the top right of the screen and gain as much confidence along the way.


## Backlog
Create obstacles that move left to right that PLAYER wants to Avoid. Collision with these obstacles removes a "Confidence Score" Add shooting functionality to the PLAYER. Speech bubbles added.

#### NOTES
Bad Bisch Score // Sad Bisch Score Methods
Bad Bisch Score // Sad Bisch Score within GameScreen HTML

For hundreds of years the view of beauty was of the curves, the more volumptious and more canvas needed the better, jealous of their limelight a group of "Shamers" formed to spread an evil philosophy of skinny beauty, things got out of hand and the "Shamers" moved on to attack about anything that could describe a physique. Queens of all shapes and sizes are now crippled by this deadly nonsense and cannot see their immense beauty and power in being exactly who they are, in the beautiful form the universe brought them here to be.
